# Active Context: voboost-config

## Current Focus

We are in the final stage of the **design phase**. After receiving important clarification from the user, the project architecture has been adjusted.

**Key Change:** The `voboost-config` project is a **standalone Android library**, not part of a multi-module project. The demo application is a separate, independent project.

## Recent Changes

*   **2025-06-22**:
    *   The initial project architecture was created and agreed upon.
    *   **A misunderstanding of the project structure was discovered.**
    *   **The plan (`PLAN.md`) and documentation (`systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) were corrected** to reflect the proper architectureâ€”the separation of the library and the demo application into independent projects.

## Next Steps

1.  Finalize the update of the "Memory Bank" documentation.
2.  Request a switch to "Code" mode to begin implementation.
3.  Create the project structure for the **Android library** in the current directory.
4.  Proceed with the implementation of the `voboost-config` library according to the updated plan.
